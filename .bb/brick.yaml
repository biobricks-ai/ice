  ICE contains data sets curated for targeted toxicity endpoints by NICEATM,
  ICCVAM, and their partner organizations.  ICE also contains other data sets
  that may be useful in evaluating or developing new approaches for assessing
  chemical safety. The data available in ICE are described in detail under the
  corresponding ICE Data Sets section in the left sidebar.  Each Data Sets page
  contains information on the assays and their endpoints that make up the data
  set.  Assays and chemicals included in each data set can be selected to query
  data in Search or run workflows in Tools. Data in ICE are mostly organized
  around toxicity endpoints of regulatory interest and assay type.  ICE also
  includes a data set drawn from cHTS data, and a data set of physicochemical
  parameters. The cHTS data set contains data from assays run by laboratories
  participating in the Tox21 Consortium (including ToxCast data). These data
  have been annotated based on their mechanistic target to simplify querying and
  to allow linkage to other toxicity endpoints through modes of action. ICE
  includes data on chemicals and mixtures that have been obtained and curated by
  NICEATM, as well as information on substances found in the Distributed
  Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database v. Feb-22, comprising
  approximately one million substances. All data in ICE are publicly available
  with no restrictions on use.
